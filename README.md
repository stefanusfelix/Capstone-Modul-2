Contents:

1. Business Understanding:
Understanding the context and objectives of the analysis is crucial. For Transjakarta, it involves grasping the goals of improving transportation efficiency by overcoming the overcapacity issue. This stage aligns the data analysis with the broader business or societal goals.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
In the data cleaning and preparation phase, we focus on ensuring that the Transjakarta dataset is structured, consistent, and ready for analysis. This involves tasks such as:
- Handling missing values: Identify and address missing values in the dataset, either by imputation or removal, depending on the significance of the missing data.
- Data formatting: Standardize data formats across different columns, such as date/time formats or categorical variables.
- Removing duplicates: Eliminate duplicate records to avoid skewing analysis results.
- Adding new columns: Create new columns to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.
- Data integration: Merge data from different sources if necessary to enrich the dataset for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA involves analyzing the Transjakarta dataset to uncover patterns using data visualization:
Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the Transjakarta dataset and communicating insights effectively involves uncovering customer behavior patterns. Some common visualization techniques include:
- Line Charts: Display trends in transaction counts (number of passengers) over time (day and hour).
- Bar Charts: Compare different number of transactions (number of passengers) by related category (gender, paycard bank, and age).

4. Problem-Solution Analysis:
In the problem-solution analysis, identifying specific challenges or opportunities related to the Transjakarta dataset and propose solutions or recommendations to address them.
